## Overview

### The challenge

This has been the most challenging css work I've ever done, the whole design save for the dog images, profile picture and google icons was made with CSS(thankfully using sass) and HTML.
The most challenging aspect was positioning everything where it would fit the design pixel perfectly, it does not scale to every resolution(as it is not the point), but scales very well for desktop.

Used my windows snipping tool to take a snapshot of what it looks like on my machine.

## My process

I started with the HTML markup, making sure all elements were semantically arranged as I had to make due with using only the box-model to create convincing box-shadows, padding and margins resembling a mobile device.
The best part was getting the linear-gradient property correctly.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learnt that with enough patience, even the most impossible looking layouts can be done. The ability to use pure HTML and CSS to match mockup designs are often neglected but this was a joy to get right(enough :) ).


### Continued development

If I do come back to this project, it would be for tutorial purposes, as I've found the best way to learn is to teach.

### Useful resources
